# AGENTS.md — AI Agent Instructions

This file instructs AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Codex, Aider,
Windsurf, Gemini, Cline, Devin, v0, and any future tool) on how to behave when
contributing to this repository. Human contributors should also read this.

---

## Absolute rules

### 1. Never add AI attribution to commits

Do **not** add any of the following to commit messages, PR descriptions, or
anywhere in commit metadata:

- `Co-Authored-By: Claude <...>`
- `Co-Authored-By: ChatGPT <...>`
- `Co-Authored-By: Copilot <...>`
- `Co-Authored-By: Cursor <...>`
- `Co-Authored-By:` lines referencing any AI tool, model, or AI provider email
- `Generated with Claude / ChatGPT / Copilot / Cursor / ...`
- `🤖 Generated with ...` or emoji-tagged AI bylines
- `AI-Assisted:`, `AI Generated:`, `Assisted-By: <any AI tool>` prefixes
- Any equivalent phrasing that credits an AI model as author, co-author,
  or contributor

Commits must reflect the **human author only**. The human running the tool
takes full authorship and responsibility for the change.

A `commit-msg` git hook in `.githooks/` enforces this locally and will reject
any commit that contains these lines. Do not attempt to work around the hook.

### 2. Never push directly to `dev` or `main`

All changes land via pull requests. Branch off `dev`, push to your feature
branch, open a PR. A `pre-push` hook blocks direct pushes to protected branches
locally; GitHub branch protection enforces it remotely.

### 3. Never commit secrets

`.env` files are gitignored. Never commit real credentials, API keys, OAuth
secrets, refresh tokens, or database passwords. If you add a new environment
variable, update `.env.example` (if one exists) and document it in
`CONTRIBUTING.md`.

---

## First-time setup for this repo

After cloning, run:

```sh
sh scripts/setup-hooks.sh
```

This activates the enforcement hooks in `.githooks/`. Without this step the
hooks do nothing.

---

## Workflow expectations

- Branch naming: `feat/<short-description>`, `fix/<short-description>`,
  `chore/<short-description>`, `refactor/<short-description>`,
  `docs/<short-description>`, `test/<short-description>`
- Base branch: `dev`
- Commit style: conventional commits — `type(scope): short description`
- One logical change per commit
- Keep PRs focused — avoid bundling unrelated changes

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the full workflow.

---

## Code style and project conventions

- This is a Vue 3 + Vuetify 3 + Vite frontend. Follow existing patterns before
  introducing new ones.
- Prefer theme tokens over hardcoded hex colors. The brand palette is
  maroon-anchored — do not introduce unrelated colors without discussion.
- Match the existing design system documented in the `PLAN-*.md` files at
  repo root.
- When editing a file, read neighboring code first to match existing style,
  naming conventions, and patterns.

## Acknowledgment

By contributing to this repository — as a human or as an AI agent — you agree
to these rules. Violations will be rejected at the hook level, in CI, and in
code review.
